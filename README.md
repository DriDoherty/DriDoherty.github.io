# Responsive-Portfolio
HW2 - responsive portfolio of projects site

Updated styling on basic-portfolio site to make site responsive to different screen sizes based on 980px full size, 768px tablet landscape, 640px phone landscape;

Known issues:

- still need to add basic '|' divider between navigation bar selection items and have it float properly between the anchors

- still need to correct styling for screens of max-width 640px to have name on navbar take up entire width, centered and navigation menu items center on entire width
