# Responsive-Portfolio

This is the landing "site" for my hosted pages on GitHub. It was originally built as one of the initial HW assignments for the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program, as a responsive 3-page website.  That original assignment is still available at https://dridoherty.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio.

The landing "site" has evolved over time to incorporate better visuals, links and responsiveness. All the projects that I've built as part of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp program have links on the Porfolio page.
